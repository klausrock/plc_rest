A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an interface that allows software to communicate with each other over a network. **REST APIs** are a common means of connecting applications and components in microservices architectures.

### How do REST APIs work?

- **REST APIs** are based on HTTP and use HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **REST APIs** can return data in various formats, such as XML, JSON, or HTML.
- **REST APIs** are designed to be easily accessible over the web.
- **REST APIs** are part of the backend and provide the data and functionality that front-end applications consume.
